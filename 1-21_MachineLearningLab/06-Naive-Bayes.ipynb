    "# Lab 06: Generative Classifiers: Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in class, a naive Bayes classifier works as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are given a feature space $\\mathcal{X}$ that could be discrete, continuous, or a mix of discrete and continuous features.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are also given a discrete set $\\mathcal{Y} = { y_1, \\ldots,\n",
    "y_K }$ of exhaustive, mutually exclusive classes thought to be the provenance of a dataset elements $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathcal{X}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "What does it mean to say that the features come from the classes? Specifically, we mean that the observation $\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}$ is a random vector statistically dependent on a random variable $y^{(i)}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that $\\mathbf{x}^{(i)} \\sim p(\\mathbf{x} \\mid y^{(i)})$, where $y^{(i)} \\in \\mathcal{Y}$ and $y^{(i)} \\sim p(y)$. $p(y)$, the *prior*, is assumed to be a multinomial distribution over the possible classes $\\mathcal{Y}$, but the class conditional distribution $p(\\mathbf{x} \\mid y)$ can be an arbitrarily complicated joint distribution over the feature space that is different for each $y \\in \\mathcal{Y}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The random process just described, in which a $y$ is first sampled from a multinomial distribution over $\\mathcal{Y}$ then an $\\mathbf{x}$ is sampled from an arbitrary joint distribution over $\\mathcal{X}$ that is conditioned on $y$, is a *generative model* for the provenance of our dataset. It may not be a fully accurate model for how nature gave us our dataset, but we nevertheless assume that it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "With all those preliminaries, now, given a new sample $\\mathbf{x}$ assumed to have been generated by the same generative process, we estimate, for each $y \\in \\mathcal{Y}$, the *posterior* $p(y \\mid \\mathbf{x})$ using the following strategy:\n",
    "$$\\begin{eqnarray}\n",
    "p(y \\mid \\mathbf{x} ; \\theta) & = & \\frac{p(\\mathbf{x} \\mid y ; \\theta) p(y ; \\theta)}{p(\\mathbf{x} ; \\theta)} \\\\\n",
    "& \\propto & p(\\mathbf{x} \\mid y ; \\theta) p(y ; \\theta) \\\\\n",
    "& = & p(y ; \\theta) \\prod_j p(x_j \\mid y, x_1, \\ldots, x_{j-1} ; \\theta) \\\\\n",
    "& \\approx & p(y ; \\theta) \\prod_j p(x_j \\mid y ; \\theta).\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The critical assumption here (besides the story of the generative random process assumed to be the origin of our dataset) is the *naive Bayes assumption* that the approximation\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ p(x_j \\mid y, x_1, \\ldots, x_{j-1} ; \\theta) \\approx p(x_j \\mid y ; \\theta)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "is close enough to reality to be useful. Note that if the features are truly *conditionally independent of each other given the class*, then the naive Bayes classifier is an exact probabilistic classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "So now we know that the parameters of a naive Bayes classifier will always include the parameters $\\phi_1, \\ldots, \\phi_k$ of the multinomial distribution over $\\mathcal{Y}$ plus the individual conditional feature distributions $p(x_j \\mid y)$. If $x_j$ is discrete, we can represent this conditional distribution using a simple table of probabilities, and if $x_j$ is continuous, we represent the conditional distribution using the parameters of some continuous distribution such as a univariate Gaussian, univariate exponential, etc.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "### Data preparation and cleansing\n",
    "- This text analysis classificaiton exercises originally contains over 40,000 rows with as many as 13 sentiment classes.\n",
    "- To scope down for further focus and computational ease, I have sliced 1,700 samples, from the only selected 3 classes: 'neutral', happiness' and 'sadness'\n",
    "- However, it is noteworthy that the each class we observe the imbalance distribution, with more density in 'neutral' and 'sadness'  while only around 18% from 'happiness'\n",
    "- Next, 3 major strategies are performed to manipulate the data, 1) deleting all hashtage names, 2) delete all words beginning with numbers and 3) delete special characters\n",
    "\n",
    "### Train & Test the model\n",
    "- As we studied, I have calculated the frequency of words in texts corresponding to each class /sentiment, then the prior, \n",
    "- Laplace comes into picture when assruing that each class contails the collectively exhaustive set of words, with the default value of 1 for any word NOT existing in that classs\n",
    "- Next is to calculate the probability on test set to answer whichch class each sentence is likely to belong to using Bayes's Theorem ,and get the final predicted class from argmax() function \n",
    "\n",
    "### Result Interpretation and Further Optimization\n",
    "- Overall, on test set, the accuracy of test set is at only 42%. But when we look deep into each category we'll see the significantly high accuracy rate on neutral class and horrible accuracy on happiness class\n",
    "- The explanation for this is\n",
    "    - The imbalance distribuiton of the data in training set where happpiness class accounts less than 20% of the entire dataset\n",
    "    - The neutral message can contain a large number of words overlapped in happiness and sadness classes, thus giving more likelihood for the model to interpret them as neutral\n",
    "- The further optimization\n",
    "    - The training data should be resampled with the normally distributed approach\n",
    "    - Implementation of more advanced technique like TF-IDF text analysis should be used to reducte the importance frequent words, and more on rare words for better classification"
